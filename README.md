# Obsidian Tldraw Plugin

This plugin integrates [Tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

## Setup

Since development has just started, this plugin is not yet registered as a community plugin for downloading within Obisidian.

Prepare the required files:

- Naviate to the `releases` tab <https://github.com/juliusgb/obsidian-tldraw-plugin/releases>
- Download the `obsidian-tldraw-plugin-<version-number>`
- Open your preferred zip tool, navigate to `obsidian-tldraw-plugin` and extract it into
	`/path/to/ObsidianVault/plugins/`
- The directory structure should look like this: `.obsidian/plugins/plugins/obsidian-tldraw-plugin`

## Test & Run
- In your Obsidian Vault, go to Community Plugins, and enable the plugin
- On the ribbon, click on the `dice` icon. When hovered over, it displays `New Tldrawing
- Click on it. That will create a file with extension `.tldraw` and will activate the `obsidian-tldraw-plugin`.

## Features

Current features:

- Ribbon icon, which when clicked, creates a file with extension `.tldraw` opens up Tldraw.
- Any file with extension `.tldraw` opens up Tldraw.
